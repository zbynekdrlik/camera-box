//! Genlock FIFO preload-reserve decision logic (camera-box #70).
//!
//! This is the camera-box-side, pure, unit-tested MIRROR of the C decision logic
//! baked into the vendored OBS genlock FIFO
//! (`vendor/obs-studio/libobs/obs-source.c`, the `genlock_fifo` branch of
//! `ready_async_frame()` + `genlock_parse_preload()`). Keeping the contract here
//! lets CI prove the parse/clamp + consume rules without an OBS build, and the
//! `tests/genlock_preload.rs` vendored-source guard keeps the C side in lock-step.
//!
//! ## Why the reserve exists
//!
//! The original genlock FIFO (#42) consumed exactly one queued frame per
//! wall-clock render tick with ZERO slack. With the wall-clock-slaved tick the
//! producer (NDI sender) and consumer (compositor) run at the same average rate,
//! so the queue parks around depth 1 — but any NDI arrival *jitter* (one late
//! packet) leaves the queue empty at the next tick: an **underrun**, which the
//! compositor renders as a dropped/repeated frame. The #68/#69 QR instrument
//! measured ~0.38%/frame loss on each OBS hop from exactly this.
//!
//! The fix holds consumption until the queue is *deeper than* `preload`, so the
//! FIFO keeps `preload` frames of jitter buffer. `preload = 1` ⇒ one frame of
//! reserve = one frame of added latency per hop, absorbing one tick of jitter.

/// Default reserve when `OBS_GENLOCK_PRELOAD_FRAMES` is unset/invalid: one frame
/// (= one frame of latency per hop, the "1 frame per hop" the task calls for).
pub const GENLOCK_PRELOAD_DEFAULT: u32 = 1;

/// Hard cap on the reserve.
///
/// History (#70): originally 28, because the FIFO drop-cap was a single global
/// `MAX_ASYNC_FRAMES = 30` and the steady-state queue parks at `preload + 1`, so
/// any `preload` whose `preload + 1` reached 30 force-drained every refill and
/// FROZE the source. 28 ⇒ steady depth 29 < 30 was the highest safe reserve.
///
/// (#97) The preload is now a per-source, runtime-settable **video-delay** control
/// (one preload frame = one frame of genlock-disciplined delay), used to push the
/// program video back ~1 s to line up with late audio on stream.lan. At 30 fps,
/// ~1 s is 30 frames — already above the old cap — so the ceiling is raised to
/// **128** (≈ 4.3 s @ 30 fps / ≈ 2.1 s @ 60 fps), enough headroom for any realistic
/// audio offset. The old "must stay below MAX_ASYNC_FRAMES" invariant is replaced
/// by the per-source drop-cap ([`genlock_drop_cap`]): a delayed source's FIFO is
/// allowed to hold `preload + RESERVE` frames, so a deep preload no longer
/// force-drains. See [`genlock_drop_cap`] / [`GENLOCK_DROP_CAP_RESERVE`].
pub const GENLOCK_PRELOAD_MAX: u32 = 128;

/// Headroom above a genlock source's `preload` for the per-source FIFO drop-cap.
///
/// The drop-cap must sit a few frames ABOVE the steady-state depth (`preload + 1`)
/// so normal producer/consumer jitter never reaches it and force-drains the buffer
/// (an overrun that resets the FIFO and re-introduces a glitch). `+4` leaves three
/// frames of slack above steady state. See [`genlock_drop_cap`].

/// libobs' fixed async FIFO drop-cap for NON-genlock sources (`MAX_ASYNC_FRAMES`).
/// Mirrored here so the per-source drop-cap logic ([`genlock_drop_cap`]) can be

/// exists to prove the C contract), it replicates `strtol`'s quirks rather than
/// using Rust's `parse`, which differs on two pathological inputs:
/// * `strtol` skips only *leading* whitespace; a trailing non-digit (e.g. `"5 "`)
///   leaves `*end != '\0'` ⇒ default. (Rust `trim()` would have accepted `"5 "`.)
/// * `strtol` *saturates* an out-of-range magnitude to `LONG_MAX`, which then
///   passes the `v >= 0` guard and hits the `v > MAX` clamp ⇒ MAX. (Rust
///   `parse::<i64>()` would `Err` on overflow and fall to default.)
///
/// Net contract: `None`/empty/leading-junk/trailing-junk/negative ⇒ default;
/// any in-range or overflowing non-negative integer ⇒ clamped to
/// [`GENLOCK_PRELOAD_MAX`]; `0` is valid (reproduces the old zero-slack FIFO).
