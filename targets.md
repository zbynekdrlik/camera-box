## Linux OBS Targets (camera-box, #458)

| Host | IP Address | Status | Notes |
|------|------------|--------|-------|
| imag-nb | 10.77.9.182 | Active | SSH: newlevel/newlevel (sudo needs pw); 60fps IMAG OBS box, genlock hot-swap over PPA base (#460); dev1 also has headless key-based SSH (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`) for `scripts/drift-guard.sh --check-imag` (#541), installed by `setup-imag.sh` step 19 |

## Important Notes

- **Always use IP addresses**, not `.lan` hostnames (DNS may not resolve)
- Camera devices use `mount -o remount,rw /` (not `rw-mode` command)
- Windows targets use `newlevel` user (not `root`)
- imag-nb (Linux OBS) also uses `newlevel` user (live-verified SSH login), same as most Windows targets
