# CG-path burn-id node role — SongPlayer (911014 ORIGIN) / cg OBS (911015 HOP), REPORT-ONLY (#1301)

`recording-verdict` proves pixel-level frame contiguity for content that ORIGINATES at the cam2
optical painter (the camera chain) and for the digital node hops (cam1/strih/stream/imag). #1301
adds the SAME kind of proof for content that ORIGINATES in **SongPlayer** (the song-lyrics / CG
source) and flows `SongPlayer → cg OBS (RESOLUME-SNV) → strih → stream`.

## The two roles (the load-bearing modeling decision — do NOT conflate them)

- **SongPlayer = `BURN_RUN_ID_SONGPLAYER` = 911014, a chain ORIGIN role** — like the cam2 painter
  is the origin of the camera chain. It is the content SOURCE whose burn id is tracked THROUGH the
  chain; it is NOT a camera-under-test hop, so **911014 is never in `CAMERA_UNDER_TEST_NODES` /
  `OPTICAL_INJECTION_NODES`** (the three copies: `recording-verdict.rs`, `recording_span_gate.rs`,
  `switch_latency.rs`). SongPlayer PAINTS this burn itself (sender half = zbynekdrlik/songplayer#151,
  contract #1294 §8) — NOT the OBS burn filter.
- **cg OBS = `BURN_RUN_ID_CG` = 911015, a HOP node** — like strih/stream. The DistroAV burn filter
  composites it at `burn_geom::Corner::BottomCenterRight` (the mirror of imag's BottomCenterLeft
  from the right; resolved from the `resolume` hostname in `ndi-burn-filter.cpp`'s host-role map).

Both ids ARE tick-excluded (`src/probe/recording.rs::NODE_BURN_RUN_IDS`) + in the python mirrors
(`qr_align_pins.py`, `mv_skew_snapshot.py`) + in EVERY `all_burns`/`latency_all_burns` exclusion
array + the `#638` push site in `recording-verdict.rs` — because a CG burn can ride into a
strih/stream recording during a CG_CHAIN run and must never hijack the cam2 Vernier tick (the
#463/#312 gotcha).

## The verdict — REPORT-ONLY, provably never touches the camera-chain `overall_pass`

The pure decision is the crate-root `src/cg_chain_gate.rs` (Tier-0, mirrors `imag_tick_gate.rs` +
reuses `burn_hold`): per hop (`cg_obs`/`strih`/`stream`) the SongPlayer (911014) and cg (911015)
burn-id contiguity (presence-only `first..=last`) + max-hold (`MAX_HOLD_FRAMES=4`,
#575-boundary-trimmed). `recording-verdict --cg <path>` emits `report["cg_chain"]`, gated on `--cg`
being supplied (a normal camera run omits it). It folds via `cg_chain_gate::folds_into_overall_pass`,
which is a **no-op while `gates_overall_pass() == false`** — so the camera-chain gate is untouched.

**It is REPORT-ONLY on purpose.** There is no real SongPlayer burn yet (songplayer#151 unshipped),
so the hold/decimation behaviour is uncalibrated. The flip to LIVE is the standard one-line seam
(`gates_overall_pass() -> true`, `verdict-gate-seam-calibration.md`) AFTER: (1) a real captured
cg-OBS frame with the SP burn replaces the generated decode fixture
(`pattern-change-needs-decode-fixture.md`), and (2) a green CG_CHAIN=1 run series calibrates it.

## The decode fixture is GENERATED — a real cg-OBS frame MUST replace it

`tests/burn_payload_parity.rs::songplayer_origin_burn_911014_round_trips_through_the_production_decoder_1301`
renders the 911014 payload with the production renderer and decodes it with the production decoder —
proving the fleet decode path reads the new origin run_id, but NOT that it survives the real lossy
chain (projection → grabber → NDI → re-encode). Mine the real fixture from the first CG_CHAIN=1 rig
run after songplayer#151 deploys (supervisor/rig-ops), per the #1196 precedent.

## The E2E profile is opt-in + leak-guarded (`scripts/lib/cg-chain-e2e.sh`)

`CG_CHAIN=1` turns the SongPlayer burn ON + StartRecords cg OBS at `[5/8]`, StopRecords + pulls the
cg recording at `[8/8d]` (feeding `--cg`), and — the #246/#844 leak-guard — turns the burn OFF +
StopRecords cg OBS in `cleanup()` even on an early abort (the burn must NEVER stay on the LED wall).
All runners are best-effort + loud; `CG_CHAIN` unset = byte-for-byte inert. The SongPlayer burn API
(`CG_CHAIN_SONGPLAYER_API`) and the resolume recording pull (`CG_CHAIN_PULL_CMD`) are env-configured
pending songplayer#151 — a live CG_CHAIN=1 run is a supervisor/rig-ops step, never unattended.

## Adding ANOTHER chain-origin/hop pair later

Reserve a fresh `BURN_RUN_ID_*` → add to `NODE_BURN_RUN_IDS` + the two python mirrors + every
`all_burns` array; a HOP that composites an OBS burn also needs a new `burn_geom::Corner` synced
across the #463 FOUR mirrors (burn-geom.hpp, colour_sample.rs, colour_scale.rs test,
burn_payload_parity.rs) + the burn-filter host-role map. Reuse `cg_chain_gate` (it is generic
per-hop contiguity+hold), never a parallel copy. The `recording-decode` skill's "new node role"
GOTCHA has the full ~5-site checklist.
