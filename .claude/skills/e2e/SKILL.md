# E2E Zero-Loss Testing

## Acceptance Criteria — HARD BAR

**Never claim "zero loss / stable latency" without this complete proof.**
Past claims of "everything works, zero loss, low latency" were untrustworthy/false (2026-06-17).

**Loss measurement:**
1. From **RECORDED OBS PROGRAM OUTPUT only** — never an NDI tap for loss counting.
   NDI-to-dev1 is an unreliable extra link; frames counted only when OBS shows them in program out.
2. **Dual-QR Vernier:** cam2 paints 2 QRs (left=even tick, right=odd tick; tick=max resolves
   60→30 beat). QR size 700px (480px gave 76% undecodable; 700px → ~0%).
3. **HARD-FAIL bar — PASS = 0 undecodable AND 0 copy(stale repeat) AND 0 gap.**
   No thresholds. No "0.02% negligible". No explaining-away. Anything >0 = FAIL.
4. Every undecodable/anomaly frame must be **extracted as real pixels and shown** — black = real
   lost/empty frame = FAIL; blurred QR = decode miss (fix decoder to 0). Prove with pixels.
5. Duration ≥300s to claim zero-loss; ideal 1800s (30min).

**Latency — exact per-hop required:**
- Burn emit-time INTO each frame (OBS-side QR at the compositor render tick, where genlock build
  already has `genlock_wall_now_100ns`/`genlock_emit_timecode_100ns`).
- `record_start` read over network (websocket/ssh) is WRONG — biased by network latency.
- Stable DEFINED latency required, not just "low".

**Restart-survival (MANDATORY):** re-run and STILL PASS after (a) OBS restart AND (b) PC restart
of strih+stream. Historically everything diverged after a restart; without this, zero-loss is NOT achieved.

**Constraint:** NEVER rebuild/redeploy prod OBS or install OBS plugins before a live event.

## Dual-QR Vernier Zero-Loss Proof (2026-06-17)

Trustworthy E2E zero-loss proof from RECORDED OBS OUTPUT.

**Rig:** cam2 paints to real monitor via /dev/fb0 DRM page-flip (vblank-locked 60Hz) →
broadcast camera (30fps) films monitor → cam1 ShadowCast → camera-box → "CAM1 (usb)" NDI →
strih OBS PHASE2-PROBE program → stream OBS program. Both record locally.

**Dual-QR Vernier (the method):** `frame-probe --paint-only --dual-qr` renders TWO QRs at 60Hz:
LEFT=latest even tick, RIGHT=latest odd tick. ONE half changes per refresh (anti-blur, always ≥1
cleanly decodable). Decode BOTH per recorded frame; `tick = max(left_even, right_odd)` = exact
60Hz instant the 30fps camera captured.

**Proof metric:** over 330s, `avg tick step = EXACTLY 2.0000` → frame count conserved → zero NET
loss. Jitter balanced: step 0↔4 = 9/9, step 1↔3 = 49/49 → sampling beat artifact (nets to zero).

**Honest bar:** report "zero NET loss" (avg-step=2.0 + balance), NOT "0 anomaly frames" —
there ARE step-events (9 dup + 58 skip strih). The step-events are rig sampling-beat artifacts,
not chain loss.

**Analysis tools on dev1:** `.qr_dual.py` (split L/R decode), `.e2e_report.py`
(2-panel PNG: continuity line slope-2 + deviation band).
These should land in repo as `scripts/e2e-report.py` (per writing-plans spec).

## QR Harness (post-#68, 2026-06-15)

After #68 (merged `68180c20c`) the harness AGREES with the persistence test — no longer false-greens.

**Run:**
```bash
DURATION=360 LEAD_DISCARD=60 OUT=/tmp/x.json ./scripts/multitap-e2e.sh
```
Needs OBS WS :4455 on strih (10.77.9.202) + stream (10.77.9.204), `NDI_RUNTIME_DIR_V6=/usr/lib/ndi`,
python `websocket-client`. Takes over strih/stream program scene + restarts cam2 camera-box (restored by trap).

**Four fixes in #68:**
- fb tearing → cam2 fb0 now `FBIO_WAITFORVSYNC` (vsync-gated direct writes, tear-free).
- contiguity/order → `endpoint_sequence_check` flags gaps+reorders; `decompose_missing` splits
  emission-artifact vs pipeline-loss.
- leading-discard → `--lead-discard-secs N` discards post-reset prime; shows real steady-state loss.
- painter wall-clock pacing → phase-lock to genlock decimator wall-clock boundaries.

**Live steady-state (cam2→strih→stream, genlock+wall-clock, DURATION=360 LEAD_DISCARD=60):**
Full-span pipeline loss 34/300s = 1 lost per 8.8s; 0.38% per-frame loss on BOTH hops.
VERDICT=FAIL (correctly). genlock-on-both-hops pending (#8).

## cam1 Cannot Run the QR Harness

cam1 (10.77.9.61) has NO /dev/fb0 (only fbcon), ALL HDMI connectors disconnected,
/dev/video0 held by prod camera-box → QR test is inherently a **cam2 proxy for cam→strih**.
cam1/3/4 each need an HDMI-out→capture loopback to be QR-verified directly (#24).

## Reporting Scope — NEVER Claim Partial as Full

"Done/working" for camera-box = full source→endpoint path (cam→strih OBS→stream OBS→endpoint).
NEVER label a loopback or a single hop as "E2E done/working".
State exactly which node/hop a result covers and what it does NOT prove.

**Backlog as of 2026-06-09:** #7 capstone gate, #8 clock sync (ROOT blocker), #9 CI runner,
#11 60fps terminal bar, #20 cam2 drop, #21 strih→stream loss, #22 OBS cleanup,
#23 per-hop latency gate, #24 cam1/3/4 coverage, #25 notify-on-red, #26 audio scope.
