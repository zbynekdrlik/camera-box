# E2E Zero-Loss Testing

## Acceptance Criteria — HARD BAR

**Never claim "zero loss / stable latency" without this complete proof.**
Past claims of "everything works, zero loss, low latency" were untrustworthy/false (2026-06-17).

**Loss measurement:**
1. From **RECORDED OBS PROGRAM OUTPUT only** — never an NDI tap for loss counting.
   NDI-to-dev1 is an unreliable extra link; frames counted only when OBS shows them in program out.
2. **Dual-QR Vernier:** cam2 paints 2 QRs (left=even tick, right=odd tick; tick=max resolves
   60→30 beat). QR size 700px (480px gave 76% undecodable; 700px → ~0%).
3. **HARD-FAIL bar — PASS = 0 undecodable AND 0 copy(stale repeat) AND 0 gap.**
   No thresholds. No "0.02% negligible". No explaining-away. Anything >0 = FAIL.
4. Every undecodable/anomaly frame must be **extracted as real pixels and shown** — black = real
   lost/empty frame = FAIL; blurred QR = decode miss (fix decoder to 0). Prove with pixels.
5. Duration ≥300s to claim zero-loss; ideal 1800s (30min).

**Latency — exact per-hop required:**
- Burn emit-time INTO each frame (OBS-side QR at the compositor render tick, where genlock build
  already has `genlock_wall_now_100ns`/`genlock_emit_timecode_100ns`).
- `record_start` read over network (websocket/ssh) is WRONG — biased by network latency.
- Stable DEFINED latency required, not just "low".

**Per-frame latency CONTINUOUS-LINE proof (#209) — the literal line, not just p50/p99:**
- `recording-verdict --latency-csv <path>` writes one row per delivered stream frame:
  `frame_id,gen_ts_ns,flip_ts_ns,cam1_strih_ms,strih_stream_ms,cam1_stream_ms`
  (defaults to `latency-per-frame.csv` BESIDE the `--json` summary — the JSON's own directory,
  NOT `--out-dir` — whenever `--json` is given, so it sits next to the summary). Column contract
  = `LatencyCsvRow::HEADER` in `src/probe/recording_latency.rs` (single source of truth; the
  Python plotter asserts it equals its `EXPECTED_HEADER` via a cross-boundary test).
- Each hop is paired WITHIN one stream frame (co-located burns, same as `chain_hop_samples_from_stream`),
  so the per-frame points MATCH the summary-stat hops — the CSV is the per-frame expansion, not a
  second measurement. An absent hop burn → empty cell → a GAP in that hop's line (= a lost frame).
- Plot: `scripts/latency-line-report.py --csv <path>` → one continuous line per hop (x=s since run
  start, y=ms). Flat line = stable latency; gap = lost frame; creeping slope = drift. Auto-shares
  the PNG via airuleset (LAN URL). Needs the cam1/strih/stream burns in the stream recording (#174).

**Restart-survival (MANDATORY):** re-run and STILL PASS after (a) OBS restart AND (b) PC restart
of strih+stream. Historically everything diverged after a restart; without this, zero-loss is NOT achieved.

**Constraint:** NEVER rebuild/redeploy prod OBS or install OBS plugins before a live event.

## Dual-QR Vernier Zero-Loss Proof (2026-06-17)

Trustworthy E2E zero-loss proof from RECORDED OBS OUTPUT.

**Rig:** cam2 paints to real monitor via /dev/fb0 DRM page-flip (vblank-locked 60Hz) →
broadcast camera (30fps) films monitor → cam1 ShadowCast → camera-box → "CAM1 (usb)" NDI →
strih OBS PHASE2-PROBE program → stream OBS program. Both record locally.

**Dual-QR Vernier (the method):** `frame-probe --paint-only --dual-qr` renders TWO QRs at 60Hz:
LEFT=latest even tick, RIGHT=latest odd tick. ONE half changes per refresh (anti-blur, always ≥1
cleanly decodable). Decode BOTH per recorded frame; `tick = max(left_even, right_odd)` = exact
60Hz instant the 30fps camera captured.

**Proof metric:** over 330s, `avg tick step = EXACTLY 2.0000` → frame count conserved → zero NET
loss. Jitter balanced: step 0↔4 = 9/9, step 1↔3 = 49/49 → sampling beat artifact (nets to zero).

**Honest bar:** report "zero NET loss" (avg-step=2.0 + balance), NOT "0 anomaly frames" —
there ARE step-events (9 dup + 58 skip strih). The step-events are rig sampling-beat artifacts,
not chain loss.

**Analysis tools on dev1:** `.qr_dual.py` (split L/R decode), `.e2e_report.py`
(2-panel PNG: continuity line slope-2 + deviation band).
These should land in repo as `scripts/e2e-report.py` (per writing-plans spec).

## QR Harness (post-#68, 2026-06-15)

After #68 (merged `68180c20c`) the harness AGREES with the persistence test — no longer false-greens.

**Run:**
```bash
DURATION=360 LEAD_DISCARD=60 OUT=/tmp/x.json ./scripts/multitap-e2e.sh
```
Needs OBS WS :4455 on strih (10.77.9.202) + stream (10.77.9.204), `NDI_RUNTIME_DIR_V6=/usr/lib/ndi`,
python `websocket-client`. Takes over strih/stream program scene + restarts cam2 camera-box (restored by trap).

**Four fixes in #68:**
- fb tearing → cam2 fb0 now `FBIO_WAITFORVSYNC` (vsync-gated direct writes, tear-free).
- contiguity/order → `endpoint_sequence_check` flags gaps+reorders; `decompose_missing` splits
  emission-artifact vs pipeline-loss.
- leading-discard → `--lead-discard-secs N` discards post-reset prime; shows real steady-state loss.
- painter wall-clock pacing → phase-lock to genlock decimator wall-clock boundaries.

**Live steady-state (cam2→strih→stream, genlock+wall-clock, DURATION=360 LEAD_DISCARD=60):**
Full-span pipeline loss 34/300s = 1 lost per 8.8s; 0.38% per-frame loss on BOTH hops.
VERDICT=FAIL (correctly). genlock-on-both-hops pending (#8).

## cam1 Cannot Run the QR Harness

cam1 (10.77.9.61) has NO /dev/fb0 (only fbcon), ALL HDMI connectors disconnected,
/dev/video0 held by prod camera-box → QR test is inherently a **cam2 proxy for cam→strih**.
cam1/3/4 each need an HDMI-out→capture loopback to be QR-verified directly (#24).

## Recording-Proof Run Recipe (recording-e2e.sh, the 4-node 0-loss proof)

The DEFINITIVE proof = `scripts/recording-e2e.sh` (records strih+stream OBS programs,
emits the on-stream verdict plan). Run:
`RUN_ID=N DURATION=300 USE_PREBUILT_PROBE_DIR=<CI probe-tools-linux dir> VERDICT_ON_STREAM=1 NDI_RUNTIME_DIR_V6=/usr/lib/ndi nohup bash scripts/recording-e2e.sh`.
Use the FRESH CI probe-tools (linux for cam1/cam2 deploy, windows verdict.exe) at HEAD —
`gh run download <run> -n probe-tools-{linux,windows}-amd64`; symlink `camera-box-probe`→`camera-box`.

**TWO missed-envs silently waste a run (verify BEFORE recording):**
1. **stream's OBS_BURN_QR must be ON** (#195). The stream burn (911004) only fires if stream's
   OBS was LAUNCHED with `OBS_BURN_QR=1` — the running OBS does NOT pick up HKLM mid-session.
   Without it the stream recording has NO stream burn → strih→stream can't pair (latency=null,
   `strih_stream_source: two recordings ...`). Fix: relaunch stream OBS with the env set in the
   launching shell (see obs-ops skill: ExitOBS → force-kill → clear `.sentinel\*` → relaunch
   `cwd=bin\64bit` with `$env:OBS_BURN_QR=1; $env:OBS_BURN_RUN_ID=911004; $env:OBS_GENLOCK_WALL_CLOCK=1; $env:OBS_GENLOCK_LATENCY_MS=3`).
   (#235: `OBS_GENLOCK_LATENCY_MS=3` is THE single genlock latency knob — it implies ts-align on and
   auto-derives the internal FIFO depth, so `OBS_GENLOCK_RESERVE_MS`/`_TS_ALIGN`/`_PRELOAD_FRAMES` are
   no longer needed; `OBS_GENLOCK_RESERVE_MS=3` still works as the back-compat alias.)
   Verify the OBS log: `[burn] filter created: enabled=yes run_id=911004` AND `genlock: latency = 3 ms`.
2. **stream RECORDING is native 1080p, NOT 4K** (#225, FIXED 2026-06-24). The OBS canvas is 1080p.
   The recording USED to reuse the 4K-rescaled streaming encoder (`RecEncoder=none` + stream
   `Rescale=3840x2160`) → recorded 4K → upscale softened the small (~300px) burns → cam1 over-counted
   (#226). **Fixed persistently in the `Stream_Obs` profile:** `[AdvOut] RecEncoder=obs_nvenc_h264_tex`
   (dedicated rec encoder) + `RecRescale=false` → records native 1920×1080; the stream encoder stays
   `Rescale=true RescaleRes=3840x2160` (prod → restreamer unchanged). See obs-ops skill "Recording
   Output = native 1080p" for the full config + apply path. **Still `ffprobe` the recording dims
   before trusting a run** (must be `1920x1080`) — a regression here silently softens the burns.
   (Profile-param changes don't hot-apply to a running output — they take effect at OBS launch.)

**DanteSync gate prerequisite (the harness can't HTTP-fetch :8898):** read `\\.\pipe\dantesync`
on strih+stream via the win-* MCP (PipeDirection.In; strip the 4-byte header to the leading `{`),
write `{ntp_offset_us,is_locked,mode,...}` to `/tmp/recording-e2e-<RUN_ID>/dante-{strih,stream}.json`
BEFORE launching the harness. Then the gate passes all 4 nodes.

**Decode on stream.lan (#193), NOT dev1:** the strih recording lives on the strih box; copy it
DIRECTLY strih→stream box (`New-PSDrive \\10.77.9.204\C$` + Copy-Item, ~751MB in ~7s, NEVER via
dev1). Run the verdict as a DETACHED `Start-Process -PassThru -RedirectStandardOutput` and POLL
the json (the MCP Shell idle-timeout (~30-300s) kills an inline 4K decode — a 300s 4K stream
decode takes ~7min). QUOTE space-bearing paths in `-ArgumentList` (`"\`"$path\`""`) or the
`_NLMEDIA stream` path word-splits. Verdict args: `--strih <1080p strih rec> --stream <stream rec>
--cam2-run-id <RUN_ID> --burn-strih-run-id 911002 --burn-stream-run-id 911004 --burn-cam1-run-id
911001 --latency-csv <path>`. cam1 is read from the CLEAN 1080p strih recording (#133), strih/stream
from the stream recording.

**Continuous-line graph (#209):** `python3 scripts/latency-line-report.py --csv <lat.csv> --out X.png`
auto-shares a LAN URL. The CSV's burn hops (cam1_strih/strih_stream/cam1_stream) must be UNBROKEN
(0 empty cells); cam2_cam1 gaps honestly where the optical read failed.

**Diagnosing cam1 "REAL DROP":** if the missing ids are PERIODIC (a ~N-emit beat: deltas cluster on
N, 2N, 3N…) AND present==expected AND the strih genlock FIFO shows `overruns=0` AND the pixels show
the cam1 burn PRESENT-but-blurred → it's a burn-readability DECODE-MISS, NOT chain loss (#226).
A genuine drop is randomly spaced + FIFO overruns>0. ALWAYS view the flagged frames' pixels
(download the `pp/cam1-missing/*.png`, decode the base64, Read it) before claiming loss.

## Reporting Scope — NEVER Claim Partial as Full

"Done/working" for camera-box = full source→endpoint path (cam→strih OBS→stream OBS→endpoint).
NEVER label a loopback or a single hop as "E2E done/working".
State exactly which node/hop a result covers and what it does NOT prove.

**Backlog as of 2026-06-09:** #7 capstone gate, #8 clock sync (ROOT blocker), #9 CI runner,
#11 60fps terminal bar, #20 cam2 drop, #21 strih→stream loss, #22 OBS cleanup,
#23 per-hop latency gate, #24 cam1/3/4 coverage, #25 notify-on-red, #26 audio scope.
