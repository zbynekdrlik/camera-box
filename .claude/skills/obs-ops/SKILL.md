# OBS Ops (strih + stream)

Canonical extended reference: `/home/newlevel/devel/restreamer/.claude/skills/stream-lan-operations.md`

## Launch Requirements

**cwd MUST be `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\bin\64bit`** — wrong cwd produces
"Failed to find locale/en-US.ini" and a broken OBS (~37MB, no WebSocket, no NDI, no log).

Use the win-* MCP `Shell` `cwd` param, or `Start-Process -WorkingDirectory`.

**NB:** The MCP Shell blocks/times-out on a GUI `Start-Process` but the launch still issues.
Verify health in a SEPARATE call (don't put a long `Start-Sleep` in the launch command).

Clear `%APPDATA%\obs-studio\.sentinel\*` before relaunch — stale sentinel files trigger
"OBS Studio Crash Detected" modal, which hangs a headless launch. Both boxes have
`DisableSafeModePrompt=true` but clearing sentinels is the reliable fix. Avoids safe-mode
which disables DistroAV + genlock.

## Healthy OBS Proof

- Exactly ONE obs64 process
- WorkingSet >100 MB (~900 MB–1.4 GB when healthy)
- Port 4455 listening
- Log shows:
  - `[Safe Mode] Normal launch ... third-party plugins enabled`
  - `[distroav] plugin loaded`
  - `genlock: ... render tick ENABLED`
  - `[distroav] NDI Main Output started`
  - NO `Failed to find locale`
  - NO `Failed to initialize video`

## Recovery — Do It Autonomously (Never Ask)

The user has repeated this 2-3× and gets angry when re-asked which recovery method to use.

1. **Normal case:** graceful shutdown via OBS WebSocket `ExitOBS`
   (ws://<box>:4455; strih pwd: <OBS-strih-WS-pwd — NOT committed; in the box's OBS config / password store> if required; stream: no auth).

2. **Wedged OBS** (dead WebSocket, ignores ExitOBS, ~33 MB or pegged CPU, crash-recovery
   dialog, renders black) → **force-kill obs64 + relaunch**.
   This is a DEV rig; the restreamer skill's "never kill" is OVERRIDDEN here.
   User verbatim: "kludne ho killni" — just kill it.
   
   After kill: clear `.sentinel\*`, then relaunch cwd=bin\64bit.

3. **GPU wedge on stream box** (`DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED` / TDR on RTX 4060, open: #89):
   OBS restart alone often does NOT clear a wedged GPU. **Reboot the PC.**
   strih: render-black + crash + ~205% CPU hang (no D3D11 TDR signature, open: #93, dual RTX 2070 SUPER).
   User directive: fix GPU stability first (suggested nvidia driver upgrade on stream.lan).

Do NOT use AskUserQuestion for OBS recovery — just recover it.

## WebSocket Credentials

| Box | Address | Port | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| strih | 10.77.9.202 | 4455 | pwd `<OBS-strih-WS-pwd — NOT committed; in the box's OBS config / password store>` (or no auth) |
| stream | 10.77.9.204 | 4455 | no auth |

## AHK on strih

`D:\_APPS\NL_STARTUP.ahk` auto-respawns obs64 from `C:\Program Files\obs-studio`.
To restart strih's OBS WITH genlock mid-session: kill obs64 + `Start-Process` from a shell
that already has `$env:OBS_GENLOCK_WALL_CLOCK='1'` set (AHK then sees OBS running and won't
re-add a non-genlock one).

strih has OTHER OBS installs in `D:\_APPS` (1ME/2ME/vestibul/input/light) — do NOT touch;
broadcast = the Program Files 2ME one only.
